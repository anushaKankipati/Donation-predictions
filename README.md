# Will they donate?

Using the Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set, we predict whether a person donated blood in March 2007.
We used logistic regression, LDA, and QDA to see which gave favorable training and test accuracies. We also tried artificially augmenting the dataset with more features to see if that produced different results. Please see transfusion.names for more details on the dataset and project.ipynb for a detailed breakdown of each test + accuracy. Also please see the Findings Report for a formal paper of our results and conclusions.
